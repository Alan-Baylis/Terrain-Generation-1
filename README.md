# Terrain-Generation
A tool for additively creating procedurally generated terrains

This is very much unfinished, I just want to it be available so people can see it and use it if they think it's interesting, until I get some time to work on it again.

Everything has to be done in-editor currently, and you create terrains by creating terrains and modifiers, then creating the heirarchy in the editor.

This isn't the intended use, it's just as far as I got, since I was focussing on the main logic of the tool before I got to the UI bit.

Also, there's a toon shader I was working on thrown in for free, if you're interested in that.

Note: A lot of the boilerplate code for meshes was taken from this tutorial on Gamasutra. https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JayelindaSuridge/20130903/199457/Modelling_by_numbers_Part_One_A.php
